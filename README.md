# Kinetic Suite for Power BI

A suite of Power BI custom visuals for operational and geospatial data built around the MIL-STD-2525C symbology standard.

| Visual | Description |
|---|---|
| **Kinetic Map** | Plot unit and event symbols on a satellite basemap (MGRS or lat/long) |
| **Kinetic Map 3D** | Same as Kinetic Map, rendered on a photorealistic 3D globe |
| **Kinetic Timeline** | Scrollable day-strip slicer; pairs with either map visual to filter by date and time |

## See it in action

The screenshots below are the included **[Gettysburg.pbix](samples/Gettysburg.pbix)** sample — the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863), with every unit and engagement plotted from MGRS grid references and filtered to a single day by the Kinetic Timeline. Open the sample and you have this report in minutes.

**Kinetic Map (2D)** — MIL-STD-2525C symbols on satellite imagery, with an MGRS grid overlay, movement trails, an on-map category filter, and the day-strip timeline driving the date:

## Key features

### Kinetic Map (2D & 3D)

- **Recreate a battlefield or Common Operating Picture (COP)** — a full toolset to dynamically display live operational data or reconstruct a historical engagement.
- **MIL-STD-2525C symbology** — render the full 2525C unit and event symbol set, auto-colored by affiliation (friendly / hostile / neutral / unknown).
- **MGRS or lat/long plotting** — accepts Military Grid Reference System coordinates (or decimal lat/long) for both unit and event placement.
- **Dynamic MGRS grid overlays** — a zoom-adaptive grid (GZD → 100 km → 10 km → 1 km → 100 m) drawn live over the map.
- **Movement trails** — connect a unit's positions over time to visualize maneuver and advance.
- **Six map styles** — satellite, hybrid, street, topographic, light-gray, and NatGeo basemaps (3D adds 3D terrain + hillshade).
- **Area overlays / geofences** — define fenced areas from inline GeoJSON or a URL and draw them on the map.
- **Built-in overlay filter** — an on-map category panel that filters the map's own symbols and the rest of the report page.
- **Co-located stacking** — automatically spreads items sharing the same point so nothing hides behind another symbol, keeping the view clean.
- **Custom hover-over information** — choose exactly which fields appear in the tooltip when you hover a symbol.
- **Deep customization** — fine control over spacing, sizes, label gaps, and offsets across every element.
- **3D extras** — a photorealistic 3D globe with terrain exaggeration, hillshade, a compass rose, and free view rotation.

### Kinetic Timeline

- **Day-strip date selection** — scroll to any date and **ctrl + click** or **click-drag** to select single days or a contiguous range.
- **Within-day time filter** — drag a time-of-day slider to scope fast-moving events down to the hour inside a single day.
- **Historical-date support** — handles dates earlier than standardized time zones, so you can faithfully recreate historical events (the 1863 Gettysburg sample relies on this).
- **Customizable coloring** — many pre-made color schemes plus custom color overrides.
- **Page-wide sync** — emits a standard Power BI filter that scopes every visual on the page, including both Kinetic maps.

## Kinetic Map — field reference

### Data field wells

| Field well | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | Text | Unit or event label shown beneath the symbol |
| **MGRS** | Text | Military Grid Reference System string (e.g. `16SBK1234567890`). Takes priority over Lat/Lon when both are bound. |
| **Lat** | Decimal | Latitude in decimal degrees |
| **Lon** | Decimal | Longitude in decimal degrees |
| **Symbol Type** | Text | A friendly **alias** (e.g. `infantry`) or a raw MIL-STD-2525C SIDC string. See [Symbol aliases](#symbol-aliases) and [Symbol codes](#symbol-codes-sidc) below. |
| **Affiliation** | Text | `F` Friendly · `H` Hostile · `N` Neutral · `U` Unknown |
| **Organization** | Text | Groups units for color-by-organization mode |
| **Color** | Text | Hex (`#FF6600`) or CSS color name to override the symbol fill |
| **Date** | Date/Time | Enables movement trails and timeline filtering |
| **Filter** | Any | Category field exposed in the filter overlay panel *(paid)* |
| **Priority** | Number | Z-order for overlapping symbols — higher number renders on top |

### Symbol aliases

You rarely need to type a raw 15-character SIDC. The **Symbol Type** field accepts a plain-English **alias** and Kinetic resolves it to the correct MIL-STD-2525C symbol, with a sensible default affiliation you can override via the **Affiliation** or **Color** fields. Aliases are **case-insensitive** and tolerate extra spaces, and most symbols answer to several synonyms.

There are three ways to set a symbol:

1. **Friendly alias** — e.g. `infantry`, `armor`, `field artillery`, `helicopter`, `ied`, `sniper`. Over **230 unit aliases** and **600 event aliases** are recognized.
2. **Raw 2525C SIDC** — any valid 15-character code, e.g. `SFGPUCI---E----` (see [Symbol codes](#symbol-codes-sidc) below).
3. **Custom glyph** — `CUSTOM:<glyph>` for shapes 2525C has no clean symbol for: `CUSTOM:building`, plus `bug` / `rodent` / `bird` / `reptile` for infestations.

#### Free vs. paid aliases

The **free tier** renders a core set of ~30 symbols — listed below — at full fidelity. Every alias/synonym of a free symbol works without a license. The **full library** (~340 symbols, every other alias) requires a Kinetic license; until then a locked symbol renders as a neutral grey dot in place of its glyph. Aliases are still *accepted* when unlicensed — only the paid glyph is withheld — so a report authored with a license degrades gracefully rather than breaking.

**Free unit symbols**

| Symbol | Aliases you can type |
|---|---|
| Infantry | `infantry` |
| Armor | `armor`, `armour` |
| Field artillery | `field artillery`, `artillery`, `arty`, `fa` |

Anything outside this list — the rest of the ~340-symbol library — is a paid symbol. See [Licensing](#licensing).

### Symbol codes (SIDC)

Kinetic Map uses the **MIL-STD-2525C** Symbol Identification Code (SIDC) — a 15-character string that encodes the symbol's scheme, affiliation, category, function, and modifiers.

**Structure:**

```
Position:  1    2    3    4    5-6   7-10   11-12  13-14  15
           |    |    |    |    |     |      |      |      |
           S    F    G    P    U C   ------  --    --     -
           ^    ^    ^    ^    ^ ^

           |    |    |    |    Status
           |    |    |    Function ID (4 chars, pos 7-10)
           |    |    Category
           |    Affiliation

```

**Position 1 — Coding scheme**

| Code | Scheme |

| `SHGPUCI---E----` | Hostile infantry company |
| `SHGPUCD---F----` | Hostile armor battalion |
| `SUGPUCI--------` | Unknown infantry unit |

**Minimal working SIDC**

If you only need a symbol to appear without a specific type, use a 15-character string padded with `-`:

```
SFGP-----------    <- Friendly ground (generic)
SFAP-----------    <- Friendly air (generic)
SHGP-----------    <- Hostile ground (generic)
```
